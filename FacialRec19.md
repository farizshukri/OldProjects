This example simplifies mood detection based on the size of the face area, which is not accurate for real-world applications. Real emotion recognition systems use more sophisticated models trained on datasets containing labeled emotions.<br>

For practical applications, deep learning models such as CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) trained on datasets like CK+ or FER2013 are more suitable.
